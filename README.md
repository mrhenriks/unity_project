# SPLAT
## Image Processing and Virtual Reality [ENSEA]

### About: 
Splat is a Unity 3D game created by Brianna, Caroline, and Matthew, who are students studying abroad at ENSEA. The game is a simple strategy game. The goal of the game is to reach the highest level and collect as many points as possible. The player is assigned a cube of a random color (red, blue, yellow, or green). Drops of paint progressively drop down from the sky in the various colors (red, blue, yellow, or green). To collect points the player has to move its cube, using the arrow keys on their keyboard, under the drops of paint that match the color they've been assigned before the paint hits the ground. If the player accidentally catches the droplet of a different color they lose the game. At each level, more paint drops and they drop faster which increases the difficulty. 


Level One:
The correct capture of each droplet adds one point to the total score. Once the player reaches the total amount of points needed to advance to the next level they will reach level two. 

Level Two:
The correct capture of each droplet adds two points to the total score. Once the player reaches the total amount of points needed to advance to the next level they will reach level three.

Level Three:
The correct capture of each droplet adds five points to the total score. The user collects as many points as possible until the game is over.
